<?php $this->renderPartial('application.modules.service.contract_templates._header', array('model'=>$model));?>

<p>
	All the dermal fillers used in our practice are made of substances naturally found in your body. Over time, these will be broken down naturally by your body.  Although the most frequently treated areas are nasolabial folds, oral commissures, and lips, the area around the cheekbones may be injected to give the face a younger, fuller and more natural appearance.   You may experience discomfort during injection.  Anesthetic is used on the skin and is mixed with the filler to minimize this discomfort.  The procedure takes about 30-60 minutes.

	<li>Multiple injections might be made depending on the site, depth of the wrinkle, and technique used.</li>

<h2>RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS</h2>

<p>It has been explained to me that there are certain inherent and potential risks and side effects in any invasive procedure and in this specific instance such risks include but are not limited to: 1) Post treatment discomfort, swelling, redness, and bruising, <br/>2) Post treatment bacterial, viral, and/or fungal infection requiring further treatment, 3) Allergic reaction</p>

<p>The most common symptoms include temporary injection site reactions such as swelling, pain/tenderness, redness, and lumps/bumps which are normal. These reactions are typically mild and go away within 3 days.  Consistent icing of these areas in the first 12 hours substantially reduces these symptoms.   Some patients may experience one or more of these symptoms for a longer period of time; however, these symptoms typically go away without treatment.   Patients using aspirin, ibuprofen, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or warfarin (a blood thinner) prior to treatment with may notice increased bruising or bleeding at or near the injection sites.</p>
