<ol>
	<li>Before any laser treatment you must avoid sun exposure, tanning beds and tanning creams for approximately one month and refrain from these throughout the course of the remaining treatments.</li>
	<li>Shave the area that is to be treated the day of the appointment to ensure a clean hairless surface. This hair, if not shaved, will absorb the laser energy and superficial thermal injury can occur. Note that if we have to shave the area this will prolong the appointment time and a fee will be charged.</li>
	<li>For under arms, it is important to NOT use any anti-perspirants or deodorants on the day of the appointment.</li>
	<li>On the day of the appointment try to avoid any perfumes, colognes, after-shave, or body lotions on the area to be treated. Use no topical products if at all possible as a photochemical reaction causing skin darkening could occur.</li>
	<li>For treatment on the bikini area please dress appropriately and bring a change of clothing or any hygiene products that might as needed.</li>
	<li>Please note that once the decision has been made to begin laser hair removal treatments, you are no longer allowed to tweeze, wax, or use hair removal creams in between treatment. You may only shave the area to be treated.</li>
	<li>Wait 2 weeks before/after having injectable or filler procedures in the treatment area</li>
</ol>

<p>I authorize OPM – Med Spa and its designated staff to perform Laser Hair Removal on my body. I understand that Laser Hair Removal is an FDA –approved treatment method for removing unwanted hair. I have been advised of the possible adverse reactions which are as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Short term effects may include reddening, swelling, bumps, mild burning, temporary bruising or blistering. Hyperpigmentation (browning of skin) and Hypopigmentation (lightening of skin), although rare, may occur. These conditions usually resolve within 3 – 6 months, but permanent color change is a rare risk, less than 1%. Avoiding sun exposure before and after treatment reduces the risk of color change.</li>
	<li>Infection following treatment is quite unusual, but bacterial, fungal and viral infections can occur. Herpes simplex virus infections around the mouth can be stimulated by laser treatment. This applies to both individuals with a past history of herpes simplex virus infections and individuals with no known history of herpes simplex virus infections in the mouth area. Should any type of skin infection occur, additional skin treatments or medical antibiotics may be necessary.</li>
	<li>Allergic reactions, although very rare, may occur. Local skin allergies to topical preparations, tape, or preservatives used in cosmetics can occur.</li>
	<li>However slight, there is a risk of scarring.</li>
	<li>Pinpoint bleeding, although very rare, may occur following treatment procedures. Should bleeding occur, additional skin treatment may be necessary.</li>
	<li>Eye protection must be worn at all time because exposure to laser light could harm one’s vision.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	<b>By signing below, I acknowledge that I have read the adverse reactions above and I feel that I have been adequately informed of the risks of Laser Hair Removal treatments. Before each treatment I will inform the laser technician if I have taken any new medications since my last treatment or if I have tanned the areas to be treated either by sunlight or artificially. I understand that tanning and some medications can make my skin photosensitive. I also understand that either of the formentioned conditions could cause the laser to damage my skin. I also agree to comply with the recommended aftercare instructions which are crucial for healing and prevention of scarring and hyperpigmentation. I hereby release OPM and its designated staff from liability associated with the above.</b>

	<b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: My questions regarding the Laser Hair Removal procedures have been answered satisfactorily. I understand the procedure and accept the risks. I hereby release OPM Med Spa and Lorine Mikhael from all liabilities associated with the above indicated procedure.</b>
