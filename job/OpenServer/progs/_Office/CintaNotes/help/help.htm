    <h2 id="about">About CintaNotes</h2>

            <p>CintaNotes is a small and easy to use personal note management application. It is designed to be your
            indispensable assistant in the daily task of collecting numerous pieces of information, whatever they may be: your
            own thoughts and ideas, book and article excerpts, job postings, famous quotes, research data, curious facts,
            Wikipedia definitions, blog posts, important news, you name it.</p>

            <p>It lets you quickly jot down and tag any piece of useful information that you come across while reading
            documents or surfing the Net - just select the text and press Ctrl+F12. With CintaNotes, this is really all it
            takes to make a note! CintaNotes does not clutter your workspace with "sticky notes", all notes are neatly
            organized in an easily navigable list. And unlike browser-based tools like Google Notebook or Firefox plug-ins
            CintaNotes does not require a web browser to work - it works with Microsoft Word, Outlook, Adobe Acrobat - the
            "text-capturing magic" works with all applications that can copy text to clipboard!</p>

            <p>Retrieving information is also trivial: just open CintaNotes and start typing, and only notes which contain the
            text you type will remain in the list. More sophisticated search criteria are also supported, like searching by
            title or by URL the note was taken from.</p>

            <p>CintaNotes is a totally portable application, meaning that you can put it on a flash drive and run it directly
            from there - in this way, your notes will always be with you.</p>

            <h2 id="sysreq">System Requirements</h2>

            <p>CintaNotes runs under Microsoft Windows&#174; XP and above. No additional runtime support libraries
            are required.</p>

    <h2 id="install">Installing, Licensing and Updating</h2>

        <h3>Installation</h3>

            <p>Installing CintaNotes is straightforward: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>In your web browser, click the link to the program.</li>

                <li>To install the program immediately, click "Open" or "Run", and then follow the instructions. If you're 
                    prompted by Windows User Access Control for an administrator password, type 
                    the password.
                    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - How to Install" src="images/install01.png" width="454" height="350">
                </li>

                    <li>Click "Next" and then accept the end-user license agreement.
                        <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - End-user license Agreement" src="images/install03.png" width="543" height="429">
                    </li>

                    <li>Select the folder where CintaNotes will reside ("Program Files" by default). You can choose a different folder by clicking the "Browse" button.
                        <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Application - Select Installation Destination Folder" src="images/install04.png" width="543" height="429">
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Then you'll be asked for the Start Menu folder name. You'll only want to change it if you already have the start menu folder with this name,
                        e.g when installing multiple instances of CintaNotes.
                        <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipping Software - Start Menu Folder Name" src="images/install06.png" width="543" height="429">
                    </li>

                    <li>After the installation is complete, click "Launch CintaNotes" and then "Finish" to get rolling.
                        <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipper - Launch CintaNotes Option" src="images/install07.png" width="543" height="429">
                    </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="note box">Please pay attention that if you install CintaNotes into the Program Files folder, your note
            data and settings will be stored separately in "%APPDATA%\<em>YourCintaNotesFolderName</em>". Simple copying of the 
            application folder will copy just the application itself, without your data. You can find and copy your data files manually.</p>

            <p>CintaNotes can also work without installation. For your convenience there also is a portable
            version of CintaNotes available for direct download from the official site, which doesn't contain an installer.</p>

        <h3>License</h3>

            <p>By default, CintaNotes is installed under the terms of the Basic (Free) License. But some advanced features are initially locked, and 
            only get unlocked upon upgrading to the PRO license. These features include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Simplenote synchronization</li>
                        <li>Multiple notebooks support</li>
                        <li>More than 3 tabbed sections</li>
                        <li>Linking notes with each other</li>
                        <li>Tag hierarchy and expandable tag tree</li>
                        <li>Exporting notes to HTML format</li>
                        <li>Pasting notes into other applications</li>
                    </ul>

             <p>You don't have to download a separate package after purchasing a license. There is just one distribution of CintaNotes. 
                Registering a license unlocks premium functionality in the program that is already installed. The PRO license is intended 
                both for non-commercial and commercial (business) environments.</p>

            <p>To obtain a PRO License, select the <em>License</em> command from the <em>Help menu</em>. 
               The "Buy" button in the License window will take you to the online order page.</p>

             <p class="tip box">You can also request a 10 day trial key to try out the PRO features without buying the license.
               Click on the "Trial" button and you will be redirected to our website for completing a simple request form.
               Shortly after submitting this form you will receive the trial key delivered to your email.</p>

                <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes buy license" src="images/license_obtain.png" width="628" height="338"/>

             <p>After your order is processed, you will receive your registration key by email (usually takes several minutes, but in extremely rare cases can take up to 12 hours). You can enter the registration details into the <em>Help/License</em> window in one of three ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Option 1: Select the whole purchase confirmation email text, and clip it using the configured clipping hot key (Ctrl+F12 by default) -
                    this is the recommended approach;</li>
                <li>Option 2: Copy the email content to clipboard and then open the <em>License</em> window;</li>
                <li>Option 3: Manually enter the registration details into the <em>License</em> window.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="warning box">Please make sure that the data in the "Registration Name and E-Mail" and "Registration Key" fields exactly 
               matches the data in the license key email. Whitespace and parentheses make a difference!</p>

            <p>CintaNotes is licensed per user, so you can use the same license key on all your PCs. But the license key 
               needs to be registered on every PC separately.</p>

        <h3>Updating CintaNotes to newer versions</h3>

            <p>CintaNotes automatically checks for updates and indicates to you that a new version is available with a yellow information bar under the main menu.
               Click on this bar to begin downloading the new version package.</p>

            <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Picking Software - Update" src="images/update02.png" width="553" height="500"/>

            <p>You can also check for updates manually with the <em>Help/Check for Updates</em> command. The same window allows you to turn off the automatic update check in case you don't want to be notified.</p>

            <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Picking Software Update" src="images/update01.png" width="456" height="265"/>

            <p>After downloading the updated package, usually all you need to do is point the installer to your CintaNotes folder.</p>

            <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNoters Update" src="images/cn_update01.png" width="395" height="406"/>

            <p>To update the portable version, unpack the archive and copy the new files over the old content of the CintaNotes folder.</p>

            <p>Updating a registered version of CintaNotes (i.e. with a PRO License) will automatically transfer the license key to the new version. Unless you've purchased a Lifetime PRO license, your license key will be valid only for CintaNotes versions released during the 12 months since the date of purchase. If you update to a version released after this date, it will run with PRO features disabled. 
             In order to continue using the PRO features, you will have to either go back to an earlier CintaNotes version, renew you license and extend your updates subscription for another year, or upgrade to a Lifetime PRO license.</p>

    <h2 id="taking">Taking notes</h2>

        <p>CintaNotes provides you with several ways to take notes. You can enter notes manually, clip text from other
        applications, or paste text from clipboard.</p>

        <h3>Entering notes manually</h3>

            <p>Open CintaNotes and select the "New Note" command from the "Edit" menu (or just press the Ins key 
            or Ctrl+N). CintaNotes creates a new note and displays the note editor. In this window you can enter a note's title, text, tags, link and also add some additional remarks.</p>

            <p><img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes edit new note" src="images/edit_new_note.png" width="513" height="423"></p>

            <p>The note's Link is just some URL associated with the note, e.g. "<a href="http://cintanotes.com/">http://cintanotes.com</a>".</p>
    
            <p><img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Notes are linked with valid URL or with local files on computer" src="images/note_link.png" width="513" height="363"></p>

            <p>The link can be entered manually, but most of the time if filled automatically on clipping text from other applications (see next section). If CintaNotes recognizes the contents of the "Link" field to be a valid URL, it displays it as a clickable link. Clicking on this icon will open the URL in your default browser. (Note: The URL can also be a link to a file on your computer, in which case CintaNotes will attempt to open that file in the default application for that file type.)</p>

            <p class="note box">There is also a "Browse Link" command in a note's context menu, which enables you to browse the note's URL without opening the note editor.</p>

            <p>The "Tags" field is used to categorize notes (see "Using tags to categorize notes" section below).</p>

            <p>The "Remarks" field is intended as a place for additional information. Oftentimes the main note text is clipped from somewhere, and in the Remarks field you can specify some notes to yourself. Please note that the height of this field adjusts automatically to the amount of text you enter into it, but you can also adjust it manually via dragging the lower edge of the main text area with the mouse.</p>

            <p>None of these fields are required and may be left blank. After you've entered the information you want to keep, press "OK" (or Ctrl+Enter) to add the note to your notebook.</p>

        <h3>Clipping text from other applications</h3>

            <p>Entering notes manually is great if you want to write down some brilliant ideas of your own, but often you will just want to store a piece of information you've found somewhere else. This is a case where CintaNotes really shines.</p>

            <p>Provided CintaNotes is running in the background (usually it will reside in the system tray), all you need to do is mark the text you want to store and press Ctrl+F12. Et voil&#224;! CintaNotes' main window pops up, focused on the new note with the text you've just selected. Some fields besides text are also filled automatically - the title of the source application window is taken as note's title, and if you clip text from a web page, the note's Link field automatically receives the URL of the page from the address bar of your browser (Internet Explorer, FireFox, Opera, Chrome and Safari are supported).</p>

            <p>At this moment you might want to edit the new note to add remarks to it or tag it. Pressing Esc minimizes CintaNotes and you can continue reading where you left off.</p>

        <h3>Pasting notes from the clipboard</h3>

            <p>CintaNotes also supports direct text pasting from the Windows clipboard. Select the "Paste" command from the
            "Edit" menu or press Ctrl+V. CintaNotes creates a new note with the text from the clipboard. It also tries to
            determine which application has put the data into the clipboard, and if successful, it uses the application window
            title as the note's title. Unfortunately, reliable clipboard data source detection is not always possible, and when
            CintaNotes fails to find the source window, the first line of the pasted text becomes also the note's title.</p>

            <p>If you are pasting a note that was inserted to the Clipboard from CintaNotes, the Title, Tags and date
            information will be copied from the original note in addition to the note content.</p>

            <p class="tip box">It is recommended that you use clipping instead of clipboard pasting as much as possible,
            because in the former case more data can be filled automatically for you.</p>

        <h3>Editing notes</h3>

            <p>You can go back to editing any note at anytime - just double-click on it, or highlight it and press the Enter
            (or F2) key.</p>

            <p>For the main note content, CintaNotes supports basic text formatting with the help of the <em>Format</em> 
            pop up submenu. Bold, italics, underline, strikeout, monospace and highlighting are supported. Also you can 
            make bulleted and numbered lists.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes supports basic text formatting" src="images/format_text.png" width="513" height="588"></p>

        <h3>Deleting notes</h3>

            <p>Deleting notes is also straightforward - select the notes you want to delete, and press the Delete key (or
            select "Delete" from the "Edit" menu or the note's context menu).</p>

            <p>By default, deleted notes go into the Recycle Bin, which belongs to the notebook and is accessible from the File menu. But you can also delete notes permanently with the Shift+Del shortcut.</p>

            <p class="warning box">Take care when deleting notes permanently, CintaNotes currently does not provide the possibility to undo this operation.</p>

        <h3>Merging notes</h3>

            <p>Quite often when you are reading some long text and making notes along the way, you end up with a whole bunch of 
            short notes on the same topic. But in many cases what you really want is just one note with all the text
            you've collected so far.</p>

            <p>In CintaNotes you can merge such notes together via selecting all of them and choosing the "Edit/Merge"
            command (or pressing Ctrl+M). The selected notes will be merged into one.</p>

            <p class="note box">The "Merge" command is also accessible from the note's context menu. It is enabled only when
            two or more notes are selected.</p>

        <h3>Editing note properties</h3>
    
            <p>When you select the "Properties" menu item from the note's context menu (or press Alt+Enter), CintaNotes
            displays the note properties window. With this window you can edit the note's timestamps, and see the note's text size in KB.</p>
            <p>The same window is accessible from the note editor when you click on the timestamps.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Properties" src="images/note_properties.png" width="340" height="317"></p>

    <h2 id="finding">Finding Notes</h2>

        <h3>Simple search</h3>

        <p>By default, CintaNotes displays all notes which are in the notebook, organized in a list. You can enter a search
        query to limit the display to the notes satisfying the query. To begin
        entering the search string, just start typing in the main CintaNotes window. The focus will go to the search box,
        and the note list will be updated as you type.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Simple Search" src="images/search_simple.png" width="553" height="615"></p>

        <p>When you search, CintaNotes highlights parts of notes which matched your search. Additionally you
        can use the F3 and Shift+F3 keys on the focused note's text preview to navigate forward and backward through
        the highlighted matches (the same keys also work in the note editor window for searching selected text).</p>

        <p>Search strings are not case-sensitive. To reset the search filter and go back to the full list, click the
        <em>'X'</em> (close) button inside of the search box, or press Esc. Adding a new note will reset the search filter
        as well.</p>

        <h3>Search query syntax</h3>
            <p>The following search query syntax is supported by CintaNotes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>word1 word2</code> matches all notes that contain both words in any order;</li>
              <li><code>word1 -word2</code> matches notes that have word1 but do not have word2;</li>
              <li><code>word1 word2|word3</code> matches notes that have word1 and have either word2 or word3;</li>
              <li><code>"word1 word2"</code> will display only notes that contain the verbatim string "word1 word2";</li>
              <li>different combinations of the above also work: <code>"word1 word2" | word3 -word4</code> will
              display notes without word4 which have either "word1 word2" or word3.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="note box">This extended query syntax works only for note title and text.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to limit the search to only certain data fields, CintaNotes has a number of search modes which allow you do exactly this. </p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Simple Search Modes" src="images/search_simple_modes.png" width="553" height="615"></p>
    <p>In the "Anywhere" mode, which is the default, CintaNotes includes all fields in the search. The following additional search modes are available:</p>

            <table>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td><em>Any Text Field</em></td>
                  <td>Search in any of the following fields: Title, Text, Tags or Remarks.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><em>Text and Title</em></td>
                  <td>Search in the Title or in the Text fields.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><em>Text Only</em></td>
                  <td>Search in the Text field only.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><em>Title Only</em></td>
                  <td>Search in the Title field only.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><em>Creation / Modification  Time</em></td>
                  <td>Search by note's creation / modification date and time. 
                    <p>Keep in mind that the search is still text based, so you can enter "11/" to list all notes created / modified in November (if your system uses the US time format), but you'll also see the notes created / modified on 11th day of any other month. To find all November notes you should search for "/11/".</p>
                  </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><em>Link</em></td>
                  <td>Search in the "Link" field only.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><em>Remarks</em></td>
                  <td>Search in the "Remarks" field only.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><em>Tags</em></td>
                  <td>Search in the "Tags" field. This is the search mode you use when you wish to list all notes having
                  particular tags.</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

        <h3>Searching inside words</h3>
            <p>By default, CintaNotes searches only from the word boundaries. This means that e.g. when you search for
             <code>nation</code>, notes containing the word "international" won't be found. If you want to search also
             inside of words, you need to activate the "Search inside words" option by clicking on the magnifying glass
             icon (or simply right-clicking) in the search box, and selecting the "Search inside words" item from the
             drop-down menu.</p>

            <p class="warning box">The "Search inside words" option makes search much slower, especially when the number and
             size of notes is large. So it is best to use it only when you can't find what you need with the default search.</p>

            <h3>Searching across field boundaries</h3>
            <p>By default, all search terms must be inside of one field to produce a match. For example, when you search for "foo bar", notes which have "foo" in the title and "bar" in the Link field won't appear. But if you activate the "Search across field boundaries" option in the search context menu, the note will be found. This is because when this option is on, the search operates as if all selected fields were joined into one text field, which is searched.</p>

            <p class="warning box">Note that searching across field boundaries is not active by default since it negatively impacts search performance. Like searching inside words, it's best to use this option only on as-needed basis.</p>

    <h2 id="viewing">Previewing and Reading Notes</h2>

        <p>CintaNotes displays a note's text directly in the notes list. The number of the text lines which are displayed
        is controlled by the <em>Options/Notes List</em> window.</p>

        <p>If a note's text is too long to fit into the preview, a small arrow indicator is displayed in the lower right corner. With the Left and Right arrow keys you can scroll the currently focused note's text directly in the preview. The indicator by default points right, indicating that pressing the Right arrow key will show more text. After you start scrolling, it will change to a double-sided arrow when there is text both before and after the visible segment, and finally, to a left arrow when you reach the end.</p>
        
        <p>Pressing Ctrl+Left or Right arrow keys scroll the text by page. You can also "pin" the note using spacebar (or
        left mouse click), and then the preview text can be scrolled with all usual navigation keys or mouse wheel.</p>

        <p>If you want to read the note more comfortably, you can press 'Enter' or 'F2' to open the note in the editor.</p>

    <h2 id="managing">Managing Notes</h2>

        <h3>Using Tags to categorize Notes</h3>

            <p>When you take notes every day, having all of them in a single list becomes unmanageable very quickly. Note tags
            are used to address this problem. While editing a note, you can specify any text in the note's "Tags" field. Later
            you can use part of this text to quickly filter out notes which don't contain it in their "Tags" field, thus
            greatly narrowing down your search.</p>

            <p>For example, you might decide to tag notes as a ToDo list with a "ToDo" tag.
            So every time you take such a note, you put "ToDo" into the "Tags" field. After that this tag will appear on
            the Tag Sidebar (see the screenshot below), so you will be able to highlight it, and CintaNotes will display just your
            ToDo notes. Alternatively, you can turn on Tag Search (see "Finding notes" section) and type "ToDo" as your
            search string.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software Tag Sidebar associate tags with your notes" src="images/tag_sidebar.png" width="588" height="473"></p>

            <p>If you want to associate two or more tags with a note, just put them all into the "Tags" separated by spaces
            (comma and semicolon can also be used but will be automatically converted to spaces).</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - associate tags with a note" src="images/tags01.png" width="513" height="364"><br>
    <br>
    </p>

            <p class="note box">Tags can include symbols, not just alphanumeric characters, i.e. "#1!" is a valid tag. Remember
            also that tags are not case-sensitive.</p>

            <p>It is possible to tag several notes at once: just select them and press F4 (or select the <em>Tag...</em>
            command from the context menu).</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - add and remove tags from several notes" src="images/tags_add_remove.png" width="594" height="500"></p>

            <p>The <em>Edit/Replace Tags</em> command allows tag renaming, splitting, merging and deleting. Generally, each tag
            specified in the first edit box is replaced with all tags from the second edit box.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - replace tags" src="images/tags_edit_replace.png" width="440" height="323"></p>

        <h3>Tag auto-completion</h3>

            <p>In any tag entering field CintaNotes displays a drop down list of available tags as soon as you start typing.
            Pressing Spacebar, Enter or Tab accepts the currently highlighted suggestion, whereas Esc or Del cancels it. You
            can also force auto-complete display by pressing Ctrl+Space.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software Tag Autocompletion" src="images/tag_autocomplete.png" width="523" height="373"></p>

        <h3>Using the Tag Sidebar</h3>

            <p><em>Tag Sidebar</em> is a handy tool for fast access to different tags and tag sets.</p>

            <p>The sidebar is not displayed by default, you can turn it on using the <em>View/Tag Sidebar</em> menu
            command.</p>

            <p>There is a list of clickable labels on the sidebar. The first two labels are "All" and "Untagged", they are
            predefined and cannot be changed. When you click on the "All" label on the sidebar, you make sure that no tags
            filter is applied. The "Untagged" label will display only notes having no tags.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of using CintaNotes for creating a small dictionary 
    with technical terms:</p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - Tag Sidebar Labels" src="images/tag_sidebar_labels.png" width="553" height="481"/>

            <p class="tip box">The <em>Untagged</em> label is your natural note inbox which gives you quick and convenient
            access to recently captured information that needs to be categorized (provided you are using tags, of course).</p>

            <p>Directly below is the list of all tags defined in the notes. This list displays all tags in alphabetical
            order. If the list is long and doesn't fit, two scroll buttons appear (you can also scroll this list using the
            mouse wheel, and this is probably the most convenient way).</p>

            <p>To the right of each tag is the number of notes in the current notebook which have that tag applied.
             This allows you to easily see which tags are underused and can be merged or removed. Tag count display can
             be turned off in <em>Options / Tags</em> menu.</p>

            <p>Clicking on a tag activates it, and only notes having this tag will be displayed. Using Ctrl+Click or
            Shift+Click, you can expand the tag selection to additional tags. Keep in mind that with Ctrl+Click, a <em>tag
            intersection</em> is used when multiple tags are selected (i.e. notes having <em>all</em> of the selected tags will
            be included), whereas with Shift+Click, a <em>tag union</em> is used (i.e. notes having <em>any</em> of the tags
            will be included).</p>

            <p>There is also a possibility to <em>exclude</em> (subtract) tags from the set via Alt-clicking on them. The
            excluded tags will show as strikeout with a bluish background. Only the notes which have been selected via tag union or
            tag intersection tags, and which additionally don't have any of the excluded tags, will be shown in the list.</p>

            <p>Tags selected in tag union mode have a yellowish highlight, whereas tag intersection tags will have the normal
            white highlight. The three modes are mutually exclusive.</p>
    <p>Here you can see a typical tag intersection. Only notes which have both 
    tags &quot;en&quot; and &quot;review&quot; are selected:</p>

    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Picking Software - Tag Sidebar with Tag Union" src="images/tag_sidebar_tag_union.png" width="588" height="434"/>

            <p class="note box">Entering tags into the search box also implies tag intersection. The difference here is that
            you don't have to use your mouse, and that you don't have to enter complete tags.</p>

            <p>There are also some advanced commands: </p>
    <p>Ctrl+Alt+Click crosses out all tags except the clicked one, to display 
    notes having this tag only and no other tags:</p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Picking Software - Cross Out Tags" src="images/tag_cross_out.png" width="588" height="393"/>
    <p>&nbsp;Shift+Alt+Click crosses out all children of a parent tag, to display 
    notes having this parent tag but not having any of the child tags (see the 
    <em>Tag Hierarchy</em> section for more details about parent and child tags):</p>

    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Picking Software - Cross Out Children Tags" src="images/tags_cross_out_children.png" width="588" height="393"/>

            <p>Tags which are related to any tag of the currently selected set are displayed in blue color. Two tags are considered 
            related if there are notes which have them both:</p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - Related Highlighted Tags" src="images/tags_related_tags_highlighted.png" width="588" height="495"/>

            <p>Each tag label on the Tag Sidebar has a right-click context menu 
            which allows you to rename or delete a given tag. When multiple tags 
            are selected, you can merge them as well:</p>

    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Clipper - Edit and Delete Tags" src="images/tags_rename_delete.png" width="588" height="449"/>

            <h4>Tag List Filters</h4>
            <p>The list of tags can be filtered to make it easy to work with many tags.
            In the Tag Sidebar's context menu, there are three options for tag filtering:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><em>No Tag Filter</em> - all tags from all sections are displayed;</li>
            <li><em>Only Used</em> - only tags used in the currently selected sections are displayed, that is, tags having the use count greater than zero;</li>
            <li><em>Only Related</em> - only tags related to the current tag selection are displayed. As you switch selected tags, the tags are
                            updated to display only related ones. Two tags are related if there exists a note which has both of them. (So by definition these are tags which have use count greater than zero.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="note box">It is also possible to activate the "Only Related" mode by double-clicking the tag name. But since this collides with the usual tree collapse / expand actions, you need to enable this explicitly via setting the "app.mainframe.tagsidebar.doubleclick.onlyrelated" parameter of the cintanotes.settings file to 1.</p>

        <h3>Editing tag properties</h3>
            <p>To view and edit the properties of a tag, right-click it in the Tag Sidebar and select "Properties".</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipping Software - Tag Properties" src="images/tags_properties.png" width="360" height="221"></p>
            <p><em>Delete automatically</em> - When this option is set, tag will be automatically deleted when there
            are no more notes with this tag. Tags created via the "Tags" field of the note editor have this option set
            by default.</p>
            <p><em>Expanded by default</em> - Applicable to parent tags only. When this option is set, the tree branch
            will be automatically exapnded when the notebook is loaded. This enables you to keep commonly used
            child tags always visible.</p>

        <h3>Tag Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>To further enhance the organization of your notes using tags, tags can be organized into a hierarchic structure.
            Such a tree-like structure is very useful for creating various taxonomies.</p>

            <p>Why organize your Tags into a tree? There are two main benefits derived from organizing tags into trees:</p>
            
               <ol>
                <li>You can easily generalize and specialize tags. For example, where you might use tags <em>todo</em>, <em>reply</em>
                and <em>watch</em>, you can instead use <em>todo/reply</em> and <em>todo/watch</em>. <em>todo</em> becomes a parent tag in this case.
                By selecting this tag on the sidebar, you can see all things you need to do, regardless of the type of
                action that needs to be taken. Without tag hierarchy, you would need to select all these tags one by one
                to get the same result.</li>
                <li>When you have a lot of tags, it quickly becomes difficult to manage them and to find them on the sidebar.
                If your tags are organized into groups by parent tags, you can easily locate the tags you need.</li>
            </ol>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Clipping - Tag Hierarchy" src="images/tags_hierarchy02.png" width="588" height="453"></p>

            <p>Creating a tag hierarchy is simple. Just create tags with forward slashes in their names, for example
            <em>Cars/Sportcars/Ferrari</em>, <em>Projects/MyProj1</em> or <em>GDP/Europe/UK</em>. To create a hierarchy from existing tags,
            rename them (e.g. rename <em>Sportcars</em> to <em>Cars/Sportcars</em> and <em>Ferrari</em> to <em>Cars/Sportcars/Ferrari</em>).</p>

    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Clipper - Tag Hierarchy" src="images/tags_hierarchy01.png" width="611" height="364"><p>Due to the parent/child relationship, when you add a tag such as <em>movies/comedy</em> to a note, actually
            two tags are added: <em>movies</em> and <em>movies/comedy</em>. And when you delete a tag from a note,
            any child tags are deleted from that note automatically.</p>

            <p>Tags are always referred to by their full name (with all parent tags as a prefix), so you can't write <em>comedy</em> and
            expect CintaNotes to understand that you really mean <em>movies/comedy</em>. This might seem limiting at first, however in reality
            it is not, since with tag auto complete you don't have to write these long tag names by hand.
            For example, to enter <em>movies/comedy</em>, you type "co" or "com" and then select <em>movies/comedy</em> from the suggestions list.</p>

            <p>The most important thing to understand about tags in CintaNotes, is that when tag <em>A</em> is a parent,
            and tag <em>B</em> is its child, tag <em>B</em> is really called <em>A/B</em> and in all places will be referred
            as such. Tag <em>B</em> would refer to a tag named simply <em>B</em> (i.e. on the top hierarchy level).
            This means that both tags <em>B</em> and <em>A/B</em> can exist at the same time and they are different tags.</p>

            <p>Moving tags around the hierarchy is also accomplished by renaming them. Renaming tags is done by right clicking
            on the tag in the Tag Sidebar and selecting the "Rename" option from the menu.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Notes Organiser - Renaming Tags" src="images/tags_replace.png" width="440" height="323"></p>
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Given the tag hierarchy <em>A/B/C</em>, to move tag <em>C</em> to the top level, rename <em>A/B/C</em>
            to <em>C</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Given the tag hierarchy <em>A/B/C</em>, to move tag <em>C</em> to the second level, rename <em>A/B/C</em>
            to <em>A/C</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Given the tag hierarchy <em>A/B/C</em>, to make tag <em>A</em> child of some other tag <em>D</em>, rename <em>A</em> to <em>D/A</em>
            (note that children of <em>A</em> will be renamed automatically, so the whole hierarchy will become <em>D/A/B/C</em>).</p>

            <p>New child tags can be created by right clicking on the tag that you want to be the parent in the Tag Sidebar and selecting the "New Child" option from the menu.
            (Note that this is a convenience option, since the same can be done via selecting the "New..." entry of the Tag Sidebar context menu and specifying the full child tag name.)</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipper - Create New Child Tag" src="images/tags_new_child_create.png" width="360" height="176"></p>

            <p class="note box">Tag hierarchy is supported in all license options of CintaNotes. However the tag hierarchy tree
            view is only available to PRO License holders. This allows you to view your tag
            relationships as trees, with parent nodes at the top and child nodes beneath. You may collapse branches
            so only the parent tags are visible, enabling you to keep your Tag Sidebar with less clutter.</p>

            <p>When using the Basic (Free) License, tags are shown in the Tag Sidebar with their full names.</p>

    <h2 id="search_history">Using Search History</h2>
    <p>CintaNotes remembers each search that you do, so that you can always go back to any 
    search result. Two commands are available directly next to the search box: Back and Forward buttons, represented as arrows. They work like similar commands in any web browser, moving you back and forth through the history of your searches.</p>

    <p>To use the "Go Back" command from the keyboard, use the Backspace key, or Alt+Left combination. The Forward command is available with Shift+Backspace or Alt+Right.</p>

    <p>Search history includes the contents and settings of the search box, and also the current tag and section selection. Please note that each section has its own search history. Even if you include additional sections to the current section selection (by Ctrl+click on section tabs), it becomes part of the active section's history only.</p>

    <p class="note box">Sort settings are not recorded in search history, since they don't influence which notes are found, but only change their order.</p>

    <p>You can view the whole search history by right-clicking on any of the Back or Forward buttons. This way you can jump directly to the search that you want, without having to click through them all. Also here you have the command to clear the history.</p>

    <p>The "View History" command can be activated by Ctrl+Shift+Backspace key combination.</p>

    <h2 id="sorting">Sorting and Reordering Notes</h2>

        <p>CintaNotes supports sorting notes by title, creation and modification date, link and size. "Manual" sort mode
        designates user-defined sorting - this is the only sorting mode where note moving commands are available. You can
        also select the direction of the sort using the "View / Reverse Order" menu option.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Notes Organiser - Sorting Notes" src="images/notes_sort.png" width="588" height="453"></p>

        <p>Sorting commands are available directly from the toolbar. The control to the right of the search filter box
        controls the current sorting mode. You can click on the icon on the left side to toggle sorting direction, or click
        on the field name to pick another sorting criterion.</p>

        <p>The same commands are also located in the "View/Sort By" menu.</p>

        <p>If current sort mode is set to "Manual", you can reorder selected notes using the Alt+Up and Alt+Down keys. It
        is also possible to move notes to the very top of the list (Alt+Home) and to the very bottom (Alt+Bottom). The
        moving commands are also accessible from the context menu, as well as from the main <em>Edit</em> menu.</p>

    <h2 id="notebooks">Notebooks</h2>

        <h3>About Notebooks</h3>

            <p>CintaNotes stores all the notes you take in a notebook file. On first run, CintaNotes will create a notebook file
            called "cintanotes.db" in the install location (or the location of the executable if using the portable version).</p>

            <p class="note box">If you've installed CintaNotes into the "C:\Program Files" folder, the files cintanotes.db and
            cintanotes.settings will be located at the following path: C:\Users\%UserName%\AppData\Roaming\CintaNotes\.
            This is because according to Microsoft guidelines applications should not write into the Program Files folder
            (with the obvious exception for installers).</p>

            <p>You may create new notebooks using the <em>File / New</em> command, and open existing notebooks using the
            <em>File / Open</em> command. In addition you can save copies of Notebooks using the <em>File / Save As</em> command.
            </p>

        <h3>Working with Multiple Notebooks</h3>
    <p class="note box">Multiple Notebooks is a commercial feature available only to PRO license holders.</p>
            <p>If you have purchased a PRO License you can have multiple notebooks always at your fingertips.
            Each time you create a new notebook file or open an existing notebook file, that notebook file will be added to the
            CintaNotes File menu. To switch between notebooks is then simply a matter of selecting the notebook file from the File
            menu. As a further time saver, the notebooks are numbered, allowing you to use keyboard shortcuts, so typing Alt+F, 2 will
            change to the second notebook in the list. A notebook can be removed from the list by opening that notebook and selecting
            the <em>File / Close</em> menu item.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipping - Open Notebooks" src="images/notebook_open.png" width="598" height="462"></p>

            <p>This allows you to keep separate notes for different research projects you may be working on. It also allows you to share some notebooks, so that in the case of a PRO License, you may have your own notebook and a shared corporate notebook.</p>

                <p class="note box">Be sure to check which notebook you are working with: the notebook name is provided in the title bar of the main CintaNotes window (but only when the name differs from the default "cintanotes.db").
                It is also important to note that when you add a new notebook, the numbering of the notebooks can change.</p>

            <p>To move or copy one or more notes between notebooks, simply use the Cut (Ctrl+X) or Copy (Ctrl+C) command on the notes you want in the open notebook, then switch notebooks and use the Paste (Ctrl+V) command. CintaNotes maintains all the note information, including tags and dates during this operation. The same operation can also be used to duplicate notes in the current open notebook if needed.</p>

            <p>The Basic (Free) License limits the number of notebooks in the File menu notebook list to one: the one which is currently active.</p>

    <h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>

        <h3>About sections</h3>
            <p>Any CintaNotes notebook consists of one or more <em>sections</em>. Sections represent a disjointed set of notes, that is, notes which you'd like to keep separate, but still in the same notebook.</p>

            <p>Sections in a notebook are represented as tabs on the Section Bar, which is located at the top
            right below the main menu. When CintaNotes creates a new notebook, it also creates a section called "Main".
            Right-clicking on a tab in the Section bar brings up a context menu which contains all section-related commands.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Notes Taking Software - Section Bar with Tabs" src="images/section_bar.png" width="596" height="448"></p>

            <p>The <em>Create New Section</em> command adds a new section to the notebook. In the dialog box that comes up you
            need to specify the name of the new section. Also the new section is assigned a random color. You can change the
            section's color by clicking on the little colored box beside the "Color" field in the "Create Section" dialog window.
            Please note that the final tab color can differ from what you've picked: to ensure comfortable brightness and
            contrast levels, only the hue of the selected color is used.</p>
    <p>

            <p>To rename a section, or to change its properties, use the <em>Properties</em> command in the section tab's context menu.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipping Software - Edit Section Properties" src="images/section_properties.png" width="596" height="448"></p>

            <p>Deleting a section is possible through the <em>Delete</em> command of the same menu, or via pressing Ctrl+Shift+Del.
            Mind that all notes the section contains will be deleted and unrecoverable.
            If you want to delete the section but keep the notes, you should first move the notes to another section via selecting
            them and executing the <em>Edit/Move/To Section</em> command (Shift+F6).</p>

            <p>You can change the position of the section tabs with the <em>Move Left</em> (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Left Arrow) and
            <em>Move Right</em> (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Right Arrow) commands.</p>

        <h3>Using sections</h3>
            <p>Sections should be used for unrelated sets of data when you want to create
            a distinct separation. Here are a few examples of correct section usage:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Separating private notes from notes related to work;</li>
              <li>Separating notes related to different unrelated work or private projects;</li>
              <li>Creating a temporary "place of chaos" for collecting information on a specific topic, which you
                  don't want to mix with your notes and intend to process later;</li>
              <li>Variations of the above.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In other cases it would probably be better to use tags.</p>

        <h3>Section view state</h3>
            <p>In CintaNotes, each section maintains its own view state, which includes note sorting order and tag selection.
            (Note that search parameters are not considered part of a section's view state and are shared between sections.)
            When you switch between sections, the view state parameters are saved and restored on the fly. This enables
            you to define the most convenient sorting order for each section, or create a predefined tag selection
            which will be activated each time you switch to that section.</p>

        <h3>Selecting multiple sections</h3>
            <p>What do you do if you want to find something, but you don't remember in which section it was?
            What if you need to temporarily combine notes from two sections?</p>

            <p>CintaNotes solves these problems via supporting multiple section selection.
            You can Ctrl+Click on a tab, and this tab will be added to the current selection instead of
            replacing it. Notes from this tab will be added to the notes list.</p>

            <p>What is necessary to remember here is that the first section that was selected is the
            "main" section that defines the view state (the sorting order and search parameters).</p>

            <p>The Ctrl+Shift+Space shortcut, or "Select All" command in the section's context menu, allows you to quickly select all sections. This can be useful when you don't remember exactly the needed section and want to search your whole notebook, for example.</p>

        <h3>The Inbox section</h3>
            <p>An important question is the following: to which section do notes created with system-wide hotkeys, such as the clipping hotkey, or new note hotkey, go to?</p>

            <p>By default such notes go to the currently active section. If multiple sections are active, then they go to the section which was selected first (the "host" section).</p>

            <p>However, this requires you always to remember which section is currently active, even when CintaNotes may have been  minimized to tray hours ago &mdash; sometimes this may be less than ideal. It may be more convenient to
            have a designated "inbox" section to accommodate such notes. And in CintaNotes you do just that: mark one of
            the sections as an Inbox section.</p> 

            <p>A section can be marked as Inbox with the "Set as Inbox" context menu command, or simply via middle-clicking
            on the section's tab. Also the active section can be set as Inbox by pressing Ctrl+I. The Inbox section tab has a special icon.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Get Things Done - Set Tab as Inbox for New Notes" src="images/tabs_inbox_set.png" width="596" height="309"></p>

            <p>When there exists a section marked as Inbox, new notes created from the system-wide hotkeys go to the 
            Inbox section even when it is not active.</p>

            <p>Please note that this applies only for notes created with system-wide hotkeys! The rules are different for notes created via the <em>Edit/New</em> command (or via pressing the Ins or Ctrl+N key in the main window). In this case, CintaNotes assumes that since you're currently looking at the notes list and working with a specific section, you'd also want for new notes to be created in the currently active section, regardless which section is marked as Inbox (if any). </p>

            <p>(For the sake of completeness, there is one case when the Inbox status is used outside of the system-wide context: if 
            multiple sections are active, and the Inbox section is among them, the notes will go to the Inbox section 
            and not to the "host" section.)</p>


        <h3>Sections and Tags</h3>

            <p>Tags are global and shared between all sections. So don't be surprised if you see a lot of tags with
            a use count of zero when you create a new section.</p>

            <p>There's an easy way to reduce the clutter here. By activating the "Used Only" tag filter mode in the
            Tag Sidebar's context menu you'll only see the tags which are present in the currently selected sections
            (that is, only tags assigned to notes from selected sections will be displayed).</p>

    <h2 id="sync">Synchronizing Notes</h2>

        <p>If you work on multiple PCs, e.g at home and at work, or want to have your notes always at
        hand on your mobile device, you will probably want your notes to be automatically synchronized.
        CintaNotes supports two kinds of synchronization: via the <a href="http://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> service
        and via <a href="http://dropbox.com/">DropBox</a>.</p>

        <h3>Simplenote Synchronization</h3>

            <p class="note box">Simplenote synchronization is a commercial feature available only to PRO license holders.</p>

            <p><a href="http://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> is an online service for notes which allows any application to share and synchronize notes over the cloud. It is the preferred way to synchronize, since it makes your notes
            available in a large variety of Simplenote-enabled note-taking applications on multiple platforms, which include Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.</p>
            
            <p>Here are the steps needed to configure CintaNotes for Simplenote synchronization:</p>

            <ol>
             <li>If you don't already have a Simplenote account, go to the <a href="http://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> website and click on "Create an account".</li>

             <li>After you have your Simplenote account ready, run CintaNotes and choose the <em>File / Synchronization</em> command.<br>
                <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Getting Things Done - Synchronizing CintaNotes with Simplenote Server" src="images/simplenote_sync_properties.png" width="460" height="523"></li>
                <li>In the dialog that pops up, check the <em>Synchronize this notebook with Simplenote</em> checkbox.</li>
                <li>Enter your Simplenote login and password into the corresponding fields.</li>
                <li>You can synchronize all sections, or pick which sections should be synchronized. CintaNotes sections are mapped onto Simplenote tags: section "MyNotes" will become a "#section/MyNotes" tag in Simplenote.</li>
                <li>The <em>Conflict Resolution Policy</em> field lets you configure what CintaNotes should do in a situation when a note has been
               modified both in CintaNotes and in Simplenote. The default behavior is to keep the version which has been modified last.</li>
                <li>If you'd like to have CintaNotes synchronize notes automatically in the background, check the 
                <em>Synchronize automatically every N minutes</em> checkbox and select the convenient synchronization period.</li>
                <li>Click OK.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Now when any of the synchronized sections is displayed, a synchronization bar will be displayed on the bottom of the notes list. This bar will display the synchronization progress, and it also allows starting synchronization manually via clicking on the icon with arrows.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - Getting Things Done with Simplenote Synchronisation" src="images/simplenote_sync_bar.png" width="596" height="443"></p>
            <p>The synchronization can also be started manually at any time via pressing the F12 key.</p>
    <p>Now you can access and edit your notes online at the <a href="http://simplenote.com">Simplenote website</a>:</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipping Software - Edit your Notes Online Everywhere" src="images/simplenote_website.png" width="600" height="296">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h3>Synchronize CintaNotes Notebooks with Your Android Devices</h3>
    <p>If you want to access your notes with your mobile devices, follow these 
    steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with establishing synchronization between your desktop and the Simplenote service. </li>
        <li>Install your preferred Simplenote supported app from the <a href="http://simplenote.com/downloads/">list</a> and install it on 
    your mobile device. </li>
    <li>Synchronize notes between Simplenote, your PC and your Android device.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>For demonstration purposes we'll use the Simplenote-enabled Android application called &quot;Flick Note&quot;.</p> 
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Clipping Software - Synchronizimg with Android" src="images/flick_ui01.jpg" width="600" height="382"></p>
    <p>Flick Note uses swipe gestures to navigate between each section of the app.</p>
    <p>To setup Simplenote synchronization in Flick Note, tap on the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the screen and choose 
    "Preferences" from the menu that appears.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Notes Taking Application - Sznchronizing Notes with Zour Android Device" src="images/flick_simplenote_sync.png" width="600" height="382"></p>
    <p>Choose "Accounts" from the configuration menu and click &#8220;Add New 
    Account&#8221;.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - Add New Notebook Account to Your Mobile Android Device" src="images/flick_simplenote_sync_add_account.png" width="600" height="382"></p>
    <p>Set up your Simplenote account and sign in:</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipper - Sign into New Account" src="images/flick_simplenote_sync_add_account_sign_in.png" width="640" height="415"></p>
    <p>Your notes will be downloaded to your Android device.</p> 
    <h3>Working with Several Notebooks on Your Android Device</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately you can synchronize only one CintaNotes 
    notebook per Simplenote account. If you need to synchronize several 
    notebooks, create additional Simplenote accounts with different email 
    addresses and add the new account to Flick Note (go to &#8220;Preferences&#8221; and 
    then click &#8220;Add New Account&#8221;).
    Flick Note allows you to switch your Simplenote accounts. Tap on the three 
    dots in the upper right -hand corner and choose &#8220;Switch Account&#8221; from the 
    dialogue box.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="SimpleNote Note Clipping Software - Working with Several Notebooks on Android Devices" src="images/flick_simplenote_sync_switch_account.png" width="640" height="415"></p>
    <p>Choose your Simplenote account in the dialogue box:
    </p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking App - Switch Notebook on Android" src="images/flick_simplenote_sync_switch_account02.png" width="680" height="440"></p>
    <p>The notes will be downloaded from the Simplenote server.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>

        <h3>Dropbox Synchronization</h3>

            <p>Dropbox synchronization is available in the free version of the software. Its advantage over Simplenote synchronization
            is that no data transformations take place, so on all end PCs you'll get exactly the same database. Also Dropbox allows synchronizing the whole notebook and not just one section of it.</p>

            <p>The downside of this kind of synchronization is that as CintaNotes is a Windows-only program, it can sync only to other Windows PCs, and you won't have access to your notes online or on other platforms.</p>

            <p>The recommended way to setup Dropbox synchronization is as follows:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Go to the <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox website</a> and install the Dropbox client. A synchronized folder called "My Dropbox" will be created.</li>
              <li>Make sure that the CintaNotes program and settings files are outside of this Dropbox folder (e.g. in "C:\CintaNotes").</li>
              <li>Run CintaNotes</li>
              <li>Save a copy of your notebook inside of the "My DropBox" folder using the <em>File / Save As...</em> menu command.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>On each other PC, run CintaNotes and open this synchronized notebook file using the <em>File / Open...</em> command. That's it! Now your notes will be automatically synchronized. Configuring for other synchronization services like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, or SugarSync is similar.</p>

            <p>Moving CintaNotes program and settings files into the Dropbox folder is NOT recommended because:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The backup files will constantly be "conflicted";</li>
              <li>You won't be able to have separate settings on different PCs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You don't have to close CintaNotes for your notes to be synchronized. After the period of inactivity
            of 30 seconds, CintaNotes releases the notebook file lock. But please allow some time (usually about 2-10 minutes,
            depending on your internet connection) for a full synchronization cycle.</p>

            <p>Please note that if you take notes offline, or shutdown the computer right after you've created some notes,
            these last notes may not be synchronized, and if you then take notes on another PC, conflicts might arise. With
            DropBox, you will notice them with the appearance of the "conflicted copy" notebook files alongside your notebook file. If you see these files, you will need to merge them back into your main notebook file.</p>

            <p>To do that use the <em>File / Import...</em> command on this conflicted file. The import command filters out
            duplicate notes automatically, so that you will only get the notes that you don't have. This
            handles the most frequent case of added notes, but in case of modified or deleted notes you may still have to
            delete unnecessary notes by hand.</p>

    <h2 id="pasting_to_other_apps">Pasting Notes to Other Applications</h2>

        <p class="note box">Pasting notes to other applications is a commercial feature available only to PRO license holders.</p>
        
        <p>CintaNotes allows you to extract the content of a note to another application running on your Windows PC.
        Pressing Ctrl+Enter or the middle mouse button will paste the currently selected note (or notes) into the
        Windows application that was running immediately prior to opening CintaNotes.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipping Software - extract the content of a note to another application" src="images/extract_note.png" width="600" height="365"></p>

        <p>This feature is a great time saver when writing a report for example. You can be writing in Word, then
        switch to CintaNotes, select a note which you want to quote, hit Ctrl+Enter and the note is there in your
        document and you can continue writing.</p>

        <p>Pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter (or Shift+Middle click) inserts all note fields and not only note text.</p>

        <p class="tip box">The most ergonomic way of using this feature is combining it with the Show/Hide Window hot key configured
        in <em>Options / Hot Keys...</em>.</p>

    <h2 id="notelinks">Linking Notes</h2>

            <p class="note box">Note linking is a commercial feature available only to PRO license holders.</p>
        <p>In CintaNotes, notes can be linked with each other using <em>Note Links</em>.</p>

        <h3>Creating and Editing Note Links</h3>

            <p>Links to other notes can be created while editing the note's text via the <em>Insert Link / Note</em> command in
            the context menu (or via pressing Alt+Shift+N). A search box will pop up, where you can type the target's note title.
            When the needed note is found, press Enter and the note link will be added. Here you also have the option of creating a new note as the link target.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Getting Things Done - Creating and Editing Note Links" src="images/note_link_create.png" width="621" height="373"></p>

            <p>Also Note Links can be created using selected text as link caption. For this, select the text and activate
            the <em>Insert Link / Note</em> command.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes GTD - Create Note Link as Text Link" src="images/note_link_create_as_textlink.png" width="621" height="373"></p>

            <p>A Note Link's caption can be freely edited and it won't affect the link target. To change the target, you need to
            select the link and use the <em>Retarget Link</em> command (which also maps to the Alt+Shift+N shortcut).</p>

            <p>To delete the Note Link, select it and press Del (or use the <em>Delete</em> command from the context menu).
            This will delete the link together with its caption text. To delete the link but keep the caption text,
            use the <em>Delete Link</em> command.</p>

            <p>An alternative way to create a Note Link is via using the <em>Copy Link To Note</em> context menu command in the notes list.
            After this you can paste the link into the note editor window with a simple <em>Paste</em> command (Ctrl+V).
            Also when you copy the whole note to clipboard in the notes list, you can force pasting a Note Link with the
            <em>Paste Note Link</em> command.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - Copy and Paste Note Links in Order to Link Notes with Each Other" src="images/note_link_copy_paste.png" width="523" height="562"></p>

        <h3>Note Links and Notebooks</h3>
            <p>Note Links can be used with multiple notebooks as well. For a link to a different notebook to work however, the notebook
            needs to be open; that is, it should be present in the notebook list of the <em>File</em> menu. Otherwise CintaNotes will have no way of knowing where to find the target notebook, and the link won't work.</p>

        <h3>Global Note Links</h3>
            <p>CintaNotes also supports global note links: the links to CintaNotes notes which can be inserted into and activated from other programs. This feature can be used to integrate CintaNotes with other information management software.</p>
            <p>For these links to work, you need to register a CintaNotes instance with the system as the handler of the "cintanotes://" links.
            Since this requires registry modification, you need to run CintaNotes as administrator and activate the
            <em>Options / System / Register Link Protocol</em> option.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Supports Global Note Links" src="images/note_link_global.png" width="596" height="443"></p>

            <p>To create a global note link, copy a link to a note with the <em>Copy Note Link</em> command (Alt+Shift+C) and paste this link into any application that supports links, such as Outlook, Word, or any rich-text enabled information manager. You can also use this link with web applications.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Note Taking Software - Create a Global Link" src="images/note_link_global_create.png" width="600" height="388"></p>

            <p>When the "cintanotes://" link protocol is registered with the system, clicking on such a link will activate CintaNotes which will open the target note. Please note that if there are multiple CintaNotes installations on the system, then the note's notebook should be open in the CintaNotes instance that has registered itself as the "cintanotes://" link handler &mdash; otherwise, the target note won't be found and the link won't work.</p>

    <h2 id="export">Exporting Notes</h2>

        <p>CintaNotes supports note exporting in several ways:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Unicode text file.</b> You can export notes from your notebook to a Unicode text file via the <em>File /
          Export</em> command. This is a one-way export: you cannot import this text file back into CintaNotes.</li>

          <li><b>XML Exporting.</b> A more generic approach is to use XML format for further note processing. Choose
          the <em>File / Export</em> main menu command, select "XML" from the available formats and enter the name of the XML
          file all notes will be exported into. This file can be viewed and processed with your favorite XML authoring
          program. CintaNotes can load this XML file back into itself with the <em>File/Import</em> command.</li>

          <li><b>HTML Exporting.</b> You can also export notes from your notebook to a HTML file which can then be
          easily viewed in your favorite browser. Choose the <em>File / Export</em> main menu command, select "HTML" from the
          available formats and enter the name of the HTML file all notes will be exported into. This is a one-way export: you 
          cannot import the HTML file back into CintaNotes. 
         <p class="note box">Note that HTML export is only available to PRO License holders.</p></li>

          <li><b>Exporting as text via clipboard.</b> Select notes, copy them to the clipboard and paste them as text into
          any text processing application such as standard Windows Notepad.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="note box">If you want to retain all information and be able to import notes back into CintaNotes, choose
        the XML format.</p>

        <p>The "Export Scope" groupbox gives you a choice whether to export all notes, the currently visible, or only 
           the selected ones. The "Export Fields" list lets you choose which fields should be exported (by default all fields are exported).</p>


    <h2 id="import">Importing Notes</h2>

        <p>You can import notes using the <em>File/Import</em> command. You can import notes from previously exported XML
        files and from other notebook (.db) files.</p>

    <h2 id="backup">Notes Backup</h2>

        <p>CintaNotes automatically creates three backup files: <em>notebook.hourly.db</em> is updated each hour,
        <em>notebook.daily.db</em> &#8212; each day, and <em>notebook.weekly.db</em> is updated once per week. The files
        are written into the main CintaNotes application folder, but can be modified using the <em>cintanotes.settings</em>
        file (see the "Advanced Configuration" subsection of the "Configuring CintaNotes" section for details).</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Notes Organizer - Backing Up Your Notes" src="images/notes_backup_folder.png" width="186" height="171"></p>

        <p>To restore your notes from backup, use the File / Import command and pick the necessary backup file. If you find
        that CintaNotes no longer runs, you may need to rename your main database file before running CintaNotes.</p>

    <h2 id="config">Configuring CintaNotes</h2>

        <h3>Backup Options</h3>

            <p>The options in the <em>File / Backup</em> menu control which of the three backup files should be created and
            kept up-to-date. If you uncheck any of these options, the existing backup file will be retained, but it will not be
            updated anymore.</p>

            <p>The <em>Color Theme</em> submenu of the <em>View</em> menu lets you select the most pleasant color for your
            notes. This can also be useful to quickly tell apart different instances of CintaNotes.</p>

            <p>The <em>Notes List</em> command of the <em>Options</em> menu opens a window where you can pick fonts for
            note's header and text, and adjust now many note lines should be displayed directly in the list. You may also
            select if Rich Text formatting should be rendered in the note preview.</p>

        <h3>Hot Keys</h3>

            <p>The <em>Hot Keys</em> command from the <em>Options</em> menu enables you to change the default system-wide key
            combinations for clipping text, activating CintaNotes window and adding a new note.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Text Clipping with Hotkeys" src="images/hotkeys_configure.png" width="426" height="437"></p>

        <h3>Clipping Options</h3>

            <p>If <em>Options / Clipping / Silent</em> is activated, CintaNotes will not pop up after each clipping, but will
            display a balloon tip instead. Clicking on the balloon opens CintaNotes.</p>

            <p>The <em>Options / Clipping / Use as Title</em> menu lets you control where the clipped note's title is taken
            from.</p>

            <p><em>Options / Clipping / After Clipping / Switch View to Untagged</em> specifies whether you want to switch the
            tag filter to show only untagged notes after clipping, which is convenient for separating newly taken notes from
            the rest, and for tagging them.</p>

            <p><em>Options / Clipping / After Clipping / Open in Editor</em> lets you open a newly clipped note in editor for
            immediate tagging and probably further editing.</p>

            <p><em>Options / Clipping / After Clipping / Assign currently active tags</em> - When this option is on, newly
            clipped notes are automatically assigned tags which are currently selected on the Tag Sidebar.</p>

        <h3>Editor Options</h3>

            <p>The <em>Options / Editor </em> submenu lets you tweak the note editor behavior.</p>

            <p>By default, the editor focuses the note's title field. If you'd like to always start with
              entering note's text, you can use the <em>Options / Editor / Initial Focus / Text</em> option.</p>

            <p>The Notes Editor can automatically highlight various links in the notes text. The <em>Options / Editor /
            Highlight Links</em> option controls this behavior. In this submenu you can also specify whether you'd like to use
            single or double mouse clicks to open these links.</p>

        <h3>Tag Options</h3>
            <p>Uncheck <em>Options/Tags/Lower case only</em> if you want to use capital letters in tags.</p>
            <p>The <em>Display Tag Usage Counts on Sidebar</em> option is pretty self-explanatory, it controls the display
            of the tag usage counters to the right of the tag names.</p>
            <p>The "Accept suggestions on" submenu enables to fine-tune the tag autocomplete behavior.</p>

        <h3>Main Window Behavior Options</h3>

            <p>If you want CintaNotes to be minimized to the system notification area (otherwise known as "System Tray"), turn
            on the <em>Minimize to System Tray</em> option in the <em>Options</em> menu.</p>
    <p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="CintaNotes Icon in System Tray" src="images/systemtray.png" width="365" height="69"></p>

            <p>Turn on the <em>Close to System Tray</em> option if you want the program to behave the same way when you close
            the window (that is, when you click on the window's <em>Close</em> button or press Alt+F4). When this option is
            turned on, closing the window will not exit the program. To exit CintaNotes, you will have to select the
            "File/Exit" command, or right-click on the CintaNotes icon in the notification area and select <em>Exit</em>.</p>

            <p>If you want CintaNotes window to be always on top of other windows, turn on the <em>Always on Top</em>
            option.</p>

            <p>The "Minimize on Esc" option allows you to disable the default behavior where CintaNotes minimizes itself when
            there's no more search filter to clear and you press Esc.</p>

        <h3>Startup Options</h3>

            <p><em>Options / Startup / Run Minimized</em> makes CintaNotes always start minimized to tray.</p>

            <p>Check <em>Options / Startup / Run at system startup</em> to have CintaNotes start automatically at the Windows
            startup. It will start minimized to the System Tray regardless of the <em>Run Minimized</em> option.</p>

            <p class="warning box">Use this option with care if you run CintaNotes from an USB stick, since if the stick is
            absent CintaNotes won't be found during system startup.</p>

            <p><em>Options / Startup / Allow multiple instances</em> specifies whether CintaNotes will run
            if another instance is already running. When this option is off, CintaNotes will display a message box informing
            you that an instance has already been activated.</p>

            <p class="tip box"><strong>For advanced users</strong>: This message box can be turned off by editing the
            <em>startup.multipleinstances.activationmsg</em> parameter in the cintanotes.settings file.</p>

        <h3>Selecting Language</h3>

            <p>CintaNotes has a multilingual user interface, by default the user interface will be in English. You can switch
            the current language with the <em>Options / Language</em> menu.</p>

            <p>If you can not find your language in the list, please check the <a href="http://cintanotes.com/translate.html">official translation center</a> as someone might have already translated
            CintaNotes into your language and the translation is scheduled to be included into the next release. If your
            language is absent or incomplete, you might opt to do a great favor to all speakers of your language and create a
            translation yourself. You'll have to register on the site and enroll into the translation team for your
            language.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Configuration</h3>

            <p>Some options of CintaNotes can only be set by editing the <em>cintanotes.settings</em> file, 
            which by default is stored under <em>\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\CintaNotes</em>. Be sure to edit it
            using a Unicode-aware text editor (e.g. Notepad).</p>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt class="faq">Does CintaNotes support Unicode?</dt>

          <dd>Yes, CintaNotes is fully Unicode-compliant and actually stores all text data in Unicode. But you have to make
          sure that the fonts used to display notes include the needed character sets. With default fonts there's usually
          no problem.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt class="faq">Will there be a version of CintaNotes with UI in my native language?</dt>

          <dd>CintaNotes already supports a large number of languages, you can see the whole list of them in the
          <em>Options / Language</em> menu. If your language is not in the list, please read the <em>Configuring CintaNotes
          / Selecting UI Language</em> section on what you can do in this situation.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt class="faq">How do I select multiple notes?</dt>

          <dd>Use Ctrl+click, or Shift-Up/Down key combinations. Also if you navigate the list while holding the Ctrl key,
          you can toggle the selection on the current note with the spacebar.</dd>

        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt class="faq">What programming language is CintaNotes written in?</dt>

          <dd>CintaNotes is written in Visual C++ and builds on top of pure Window API calls. No libraries like .NET or MFC
          are used, this is what enables CintaNotes to take full control of resource usage and remain fast, lean, and
          self-contained.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt class="faq">What does "Cinta" mean?</dt>

          <dd>In Spanish, "la cinta" means "band" (or "tape"). In a sense, this is similar to the way CintaNotes represents
          notes: as a list. And, well, we just thought it would be a nice name ;-)</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt class="faq">Is there a Linux or Mac version?</dt>

          <dd>Unfortunately no. CintaNotes relies heavily on Windows API, so porting it to other platforms seems unfeasible
          at the moment.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt class="faq">How can I report a bug?</dt>
